Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up the token wallet code:

Step 1: Install Rust

- Go to the official Rust installation page and follow the instructions to install Rust on your computer.
- Make sure to install the latest version of Rust.

Step 2: Create a new Rust project

- Open a terminal or command prompt and run the command cargo new token_wallet (replace token_wallet with your desired project name).
- This will create a new Rust project with the basic directory structure.

Step 3: Add dependencies

- In the Cargo.toml file, add the following dependencies:

[dependencies]
ercrc2 = "0.1.0"

- This will add the ercrc2 library as a dependency, which is required for the token wallet code.

Step 4: Create the token wallet code

- In the src directory, create a new file called (link unavailable).
- Copy the token wallet code into this file.

Step 5: Compile and run the code

- Run the command cargo build to compile the code.
- Run the command cargo run to run the code.
- This will execute the main function and demonstrate the token wallet functionality.

Step 6: Test the code

- Run the command cargo test to run the tests.
- This will execute the tests and verify that the code is working correctly.

Step 7: Use the token wallet

- To use the token wallet, create a new instance of the TokenWallet struct and call the appropriate functions to add tokens, send and receive tokens, and get the balance and list of tokens.
